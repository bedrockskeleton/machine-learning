# K-Means Clustering for Heart Disease

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc2863c0-8075-44f7-924e-f7be36bf4f91)

My initial submission was the unedited code, while the second submission was edited by me to improve the score.<br>
Changes I made:
- Removed the "thal" column due to its many null-like values
- Changed the random state
- Increased the number of columns from three to four
